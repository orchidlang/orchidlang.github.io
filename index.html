      <h2>About Orchid</h2>
      <p>
        Orchid is a lightweight, beginner-friendly programming language designed to make coding more accessible to everyone. Whether you're a student taking your first steps into software development or a hobbyist looking for a minimal and expressive syntax, Orchid offers a clean and intuitive environment to build and experiment with code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built entirely using Python, Orchid benefits from a solid foundation while delivering its own unique syntax and features. Its development was led by <strong>Zohan Haque</strong>, a passionate programmer who envisioned a language that balances simplicity and power — giving users the ability to write readable, maintainable code without sacrificing flexibility or control.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently available for Windows, Orchid is distributed as both an `.msi` and `.exe` installer to make setup seamless for all kinds of users. Installation is straightforward — download, install, and begin coding right away using your favorite editor or the built-in Orchid environment. For developers on Linux and macOS, support is on the way, with cross-platform builds currently in progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Orchid is open, free to use, and designed with education in mind. It's perfect for teaching core programming concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, all in a gentle syntax that doesn't overwhelm. Yet under the hood, it still offers the ability to grow with your skills — supporting modular development and command-line execution for more advanced use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Orchid community is growing, and contributions are welcome. Whether you're curious about programming or passionate about language design, Orchid invites you to explore, build, and create. Zohan Haque and the Orchid team are committed to making Orchid better with every release — and we’d love to have you along for the journey.
